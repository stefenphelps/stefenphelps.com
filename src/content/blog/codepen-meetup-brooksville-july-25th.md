Over the years of doing freelance work for local businesses and organizations, I've met quite a few people that are interested in "coding". Whether that means a specific programming language, responsive design, or just web design in general. They all had the same question... "where do I start?"

I usually just tell them to follow one of the beginner tutorials on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or to check out some classes on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) — that's how I learned after all and if I can do it anyone can do it! However, to teach oneself you need to be self motivated & able to troubleshoot when you hit an inevitable roadblock. It's definitely easier to learn when there are other people to guide you.

So when I learned about [CodePen Meetups](https://blog.codepen.io/meetups/) I was super excited! It was the perfect happenstance of wanting to do something for people who want to learn, while also giving me an opportunity to grow from other developers in the Hernando and Greater Tampa Bay area. Believe it or not, there are quite a few of them!
