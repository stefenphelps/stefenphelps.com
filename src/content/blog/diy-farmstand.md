My wife has been asking for a simple farmstand for a while so she and the kids have a place to sell their baked goods and crafts to our neighborhood without having to meet up somewhere or go to markets.

So, like any smart dad these days, I gave ChatGPT a basic farmstand rendering I found on Google and asked for a supplies list. Lazy of me? Maybe. But we had to get to church on time, so I ordered everything on Lowe’s website before church and picked it all up after church.

## The Materials List

- 1x corrugated metal roofing panel (3 ft x 8 ft)
- 3x treated 4x4 8 ft boards
- 6x treated 2x4 8 ft boards
- 7x treated 1x6 8 ft boards
- Box of 2" exterior screws, 3" exterior screws, and roofing screws

All-in-all this cost under $200. If I did it again, I’d get a fourth 4x4 instead of Frankenstein‑ing the cut 4x4s for the last leg. But, that’s what I get for not questioning AI 😄. If you're a cheapskate though, and want to save $12 on that last post, it is possible to make it work with 3 8ft posts and it seems to hold up well enough.

## Step 1: Make the cuts

### 4x4 posts (from ~~three~~ four 8 ft boards)

- Front legs: 2 x 72"
- Rear legs: 2 x 66" (shorter for roof slope)

Roof slope ends up ~6" drop front to back.

### 2x4 cuts (from six 8 ft boards)

Shelf frames (2 shelves)

- Front/back rails: 4 x 45"
- Side rails: 4 x 27"

Roof structure

- Roof rafters: 3 x 36"
- Front roof header: 1 x 48"
- Rear roof support: 1 x 45"

Side bracing

- 2 x 24"

### 1x6 cuts (from seven 8 ft boards)

Shelves

- Shelf slats: 12 x 48"
- 6 per shelf, ~1/2" gap

Roof slats (under metal)

- 4 x 48"

These give the metal something solid to screw into.

## Assemble

1. Build shelf frames (45" x 27" rectangles).
2. Attach frames to 4x4 posts.
3. Bottom shelf: ~12–14" off the ground.
4. Top shelf: ~30–32" off the ground.
5. Install shelf slats.
6. Add side braces (optional).
7. Install roof rafters.
8. Add roof slats.
9. Cut and screw on the metal roofing panel.

## Final Result

Overall I’m happy with how it came out. It might have looked better if I wrapped the shelves around the posts instead of keeping the posts on the outside, and I definitely should have grabbed a fourth post. A little paint (and maybe some siding on both sides) would make it look amazing, but this is where it stands for now.
