It's hard to sum up a year in a few short paragraphs but here's my take on it anyway:

- ğŸ˜• Got Covid and didnâ€™t know it until I realized I lost my smell and still haven't gotten it back fully.
- ğŸ˜€ Shared a birthday party with my nieceâ€™s 21st.
- ğŸ˜„ New family minivan
- ğŸ˜¢ First road trip in said minivan hit pothole incurred wheel damage - spent lots of money to get fixed.
- ğŸ˜„ Started a garden / fruit forest.
- ğŸ˜„ StonkLights became a real business with the purchase of a gigantic laser.
- ğŸ˜„ Older brother launched a game on Steam.
- ğŸ˜„ Deep sea fishing for first time.
- ğŸ˜„ Two of my nephews interned with me at Kelp.
- ğŸ˜„ Condo on the beach with friends.
- ğŸ˜’ Red tide stinks.
- ğŸ˜„ Took kids fishing a few times at local lakes.
- ğŸ˜¢ Lost Aunt Stephanie.
- ğŸ˜„ Younger brother got married!
- ğŸ˜„ Started building a treehouse.
- ğŸ˜¢ Shutdown StonkLights, not enough time to run a second business.
- ğŸ˜„ Start training for marathon with friends
- ğŸ˜£ Covid hits again.

## New Years Goals

I don't really have new goals this year besides finishing the things I started last year:

- Finish kids treehouse
- Run marathon

Let's go ğŸ¥‚
