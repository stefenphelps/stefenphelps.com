SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which means getting your website near the top of Google's search results page for any given search.  There isn't one magic thing you can do to make your website appear at the top of the results page (this is commonly referred to as pagerank), but there are many good practices that should be followed to help increase your ranking.

Here is a great video about SEO and the basics on how to optimize your website to increase it's pagerank:
