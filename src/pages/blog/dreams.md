January 1st, 2023 -- new years morning -- I woke up and was overcome with the feeling of sadness. I had a dream that I was standing next to a random guy on the phone. He gestured at me and whispered "I'm talking to your dad!" I got super excited in this moment; I hadn't talked to him in such a long time! I had so many things I wanted to tell him!

And then I woke up.

A few days later I had another dream...

My friends and family were strapping me up in a straitjacket, against my will, and taking me to the mental institute. I fought as hard as I could, repeatedly screaming at everybody "I'M NOT CRAZY!" but nothing was stopping them — It was terrifying.

I suppose my brain just wanted to slap me in the face and remind me that I missed my dad and to have more empathy for someone close to me. Okay... got it, thanks brain.

P.S. here is another MidJourney bot image that I liked:
