## Why another Bible app?

I wasn't super impressed by the state of Bible apps each one seemingly full of marketing popups and having to create accounts and sometimes ads or just downright slow. I just wanted to a simple Bible app got out of the way and wasn't annoying to use. So... here we are... I made [yet another Bible app](https://astro-bible.netlify.app).

## How it's made

Using my favorite all-in-one web framework — [Astro](https://astro.build/) — and with the help of of [Thiago Bodruk's Bible XML and JSON project](https://github.com/thiagobodruk/bible) I was able to put together a really nice (imo) Bible app with support for dark mode, offline support, and even an AI powered pastor for questions (all the cool kids use AI these days so I heard).

## The future

I've added the web app to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.netlify.astro_bible.twa) but have yet to cough up the $100 for the Apple App Store... I also inquired about licensing the ESV translation which would be another ~$250.

So, this project is somewhat on hold for now. I'll be using it as my daily Bible app for the foreseeable future.
