## Why another Bible app?

I wasn't super impressed by the state of Bible apps: each one bombards you with marketing popups, requires account creation, or are just plain slow. I just wanted a simple Bible app that got out of the way, wasn't annoying to use, and put the focus on the reading experience. So... here we are... I made [yet another Bible app](https://astro-bible.netlify.app) that aims to provide a hassle-free and enjoyable way to engage with the Scriptures.

## How it's made

Using my favorite all-in-one web framework — [Astro](https://astro.build/) — and with the help of [Thiago Bodruk's Bible XML and JSON project](https://github.com/thiagobodruk/bible) I was able to put together a really nice Bible app with support for dark mode, offline support, and even an AI powered pastor for you to get answers to your Bible questions (all the cool kids use AI these days so I've heard).

## The future

I've added the web app to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.netlify.astro_bible.twa) but have yet to cough up the $100 for the Apple App Store... I also enquired about licensing the ESV translation which would be another ~$250.

So, this project is somewhat on hold for now. I'll be using it as my daily Bible app for the foreseeable future.
