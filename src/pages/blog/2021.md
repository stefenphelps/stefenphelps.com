It's hard to sum up a year in a few short paragraphs but here's my take on it anyway:

- 😕 Got Covid and didn’t know it until I realized I lost my smell and still haven't gotten it back fully.
- 😀 Shared a birthday party with my niece’s 21st.
- 😄 New family minivan
- 😢 First road trip in said minivan hit pothole incurred wheel damage - spent lots of money to get fixed.
- 😄 Started a garden / fruit forest.
- 😄 StonkLights became a real business with the purchase of a gigantic laser.
- 😄 Older brother launched a game on Steam.
- 😄 Deep sea fishing for first time.
- 😄 Two of my nephews interned with me at Kelp.
- 😄 Condo on the beach with friends.
- 😒 Red tide stinks.
- 😄 Took kids fishing a few times at local lakes.
- 😢 Lost Aunt Stephanie.
- 😄 Younger brother got married!
- 😄 Started building a treehouse.
- 😢 Shutdown StonkLights, not enough time to run a second business.
- 😄 Start training for marathon with friends
- 😣 Covid hits again.

## New Years Goals

I don't really have new goals this year besides finishing the things I started last year:

- Finish kids treehouse
- Run marathon

Let's go 🥂
