I've made my fair share of 💩 websites—in addition to some amazing websites. What I have realized in reflecting on my website project experiences is that there is a simple formula that all of those amazing websites share.\n\n## Stefen's Secret Formula for Success\n\n### 1: Ask The Hard Questions\n\nBefore anything else, start by asking these 4 simple questions:\n\n- **Why:** Why does this website/landing page/email need to exist?\n- **What:** What problem is it solving?\n- **How:** How is it solving that problem?\n- **Who:** Who is the target audience?\n\nHaving clear answers for these questions is the foundation of everything you'll be developing moving forward. These answers will influence everything from the look and feel of the website to its messaging and tone of voice. The good news is that you have access to smart marketers and strategists with answers to all of these questions! Lean on these people to make sure you fully understand all 4 questions.\n\n### 2: Design Using Data and Reason\n\nOnce you have clear answers as to who the audience is, what the purpose of the website is, and problems the website solves, you can use these answers in the thought-process for everything in your design.\n\nFor example, if you're designing a website that has a broad family audience, you would probably want to go with a playful look and use lots of colors and fun animations. Also, your content might be heavily visual—as opposed to text-heavy—with messaging that is simple and fun.\n\nIf you're designing for an executive or corporate audience, then you'll probably want to focus your design and content on showing how people in that audience group can solve their problems in the most accurate and quickest ways possible.\n\n### 3: Develop with Current Best Practices\n\nIn the technology industry, if you're not constantly learning, you're falling behind.\n\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A senior programmer is merely a junior programmer who has given up\u003C/p>&mdash; Slava Pestov (@slava_pestov) \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/966050893161361408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2018\u003C/a>\u003C/blockquote> \u003Cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\u003C/script>\n\nThis is a joke, obviously, but it's funny because it rings true in many ways.\n\n#### How to Stay Current with Best Practices\n\nI stay current by subscribing to these blogs:\n\n- [Codrops Collective](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/)\n- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)\n- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\nAnd also by following these designers/developers on Twitter:\n\n- [Daniel Burka](https://twitter.com/dburka) - Google/Slack Designer\n- [Surma](https://twitter.com/DasSurma) - Google Engineer\n- [Scott Jehl](https://twitter.com/scottjehl) - Designer/Developer at Filament Group\n- [David Walsh](https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog) - Developer at Mozilla\n- [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) - Freelance Front-end UI/UX Developer\n- [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) - Developer at Microsoft\n- [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) - Freelance Full Stack Developer\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) - Google Engineer\n- [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) - Co-founder of CodePen\n- [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) - Freelance Web Designer\n- [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish) - Google Chrome Engineer\n\nBuilding a website with current best practices determines how long of a life that website will have.

A slow website will greatly impact user experience, your page rank and can also have a negative impact on your overall brand","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../assets/images/macbook-and-glasses.jpg",[82],"hubspot","Website performance and website growth are two seperate things that are closely knit, which have a big influence over each other. A slow website will greatly impact user experience, your page rank and can also have a negative impact on your overall brand.\n\nGenerating traffic to your website is not the end goal however. Once you have a steady flow of traffic coming to your website, you need to focus on your conversion points. This is where it's important to have a **strategy for your growth** and for getting qualified traffic to your website which will make optimizing for conversions a much easier task.\n\n## **1.** Optimize, Optimize, Optimize. (getting more traffic)\n\n### Remove Unused Javascript\n\nIt is crucial you optimize everything. If your website is using plugins, has a bunch of analytic scripts or is even using ad network scripts that aren't actually being looked at or aren't necessary, remove them! Javascript is extremely powerful but it can also be the culprit of a slow website and it can be misused in a way to create poor experiences (hence the reason ad blockers have become so popular these days).\n\n### Resize and Optimize Images\n\nImages are most often the culprit to a slow loading web page, as they are almost always the biggest file on the page that is rendering. You should always be sure you're using the correct image size and image format while you are creating / editing a page. In general, you really only need PNGs or JPGs for most things on your site. Here are a couple helpful suggestions for which file format to choose:\n\n- _Use JPG's for actual photos of people, places, and things._\n- _Use PNG's for images with text in them and for illustrations (such as icons, banner ads, etc.).  Alternatively, you could also use SVGs for illustrations if you are not worried about older browsers._\n\nIf you have to have transparency in your image, you'll want to use a PNG. Transparent PNG's have a tendency of getting pretty large. However, you can save a drastic amount of space if you use an 8-bit Alpha PNG without losing image quality. If you are using Adobe, they have the feature built into Photoshop CC 2015 export options. Alternatively, you can convert your 32bit PNGs into 8bit PNGs using a service such as [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/).\n\n## **2.** Design a Compelling CTA (getting more leads)\n\n![macbook](../../assets/images/macbook-and-glasses.jpg)\n\nThe first step for a successful call-to-action is a great offer. If the offer itself is sucky, it's going to be pretty hard to get any clicks. Once you have a compelling offer, then you just need to make sure you're communicating that offer in your banner ad as best as possible. Here are some general tips to keep in mind when designing a CTA:\n\n- Use the **brightest color** in your brand's color pallette for the actual button as this is what will draw the eye the most\n- **Don't be too wordy**, especially if the offer speaks for itself or is self-explanatory\n- **Use white-space** effectively\n\n## **3.** A/B Test Everything (getting more leads & customers)\n\nIf you have a lot of traffic but are lacking in leads, you should run various A/B tests on each bottleneck you find in the funnel. If your CTAs are getting a lot of views but are lacking clicks, create an A/B test with new messaging or possibly a new button style. If your landing page is getting a lot of traffic but is getting less than a 1% conversion rate, you should try changing something on the page and come back to it after it's had another 1000 visits.  There is not a single correct way to do everything.  It really just depends on what works for your specific persona.  This is where GDD works extremely well.\n\n> **PROTIP:** when a/b testing change one thing at a time so you can pinpoint what actually made the difference for future reference.\n\nThose are my tips for today. If you have more ideas or tools you use I'd love to hear about them in the comments below. Now, it's time for me to get back to work!\n\n---\n\nOriginally posted on [Bluleadz.com](http://www.bluleadz.com/blog/3-tips-from-an-inbound-designer)","src/content/blog/3-tips-from-an-inbound-web-designer.md",[86],"../../assets/images/macbook-and-glasses.jpg","9f9448b125579b8a",{"html":89,"metadata":90},"\u003Cp>Website performance and website growth are two seperate things that are closely knit, which have a big influence over each other.

If your landing page is getting a lot of traffic but is getting less than a 1% conversion rate, you should try changing something on the page and come back to it after it’s had another 1000 visits.  There is not a single correct way to do everything.  It really just depends on what works for your specific persona.  This is where GDD works extremely well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>PROTIP:\u003C/strong> when a/b testing change one thing at a time so you can pinpoint what actually made the difference for future reference.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Those are my tips for today.

The problem with static images is they don't tell the whole story of what the website could be. Hover state, the way the page loads, or even the way the page transitions to a new view—these are all elements that are usually not given any thought and are left up to the developer to make assumptions, or worse, not implement anything at all. What you're left with is a website that feels janky.\n\n## Introducing Adobe XD\n\nFor simple page animations and adding context to how each page fits together, Adobe XD is the perfect tool—not to mention, it's also an extremely quick way to design page layouts.\n\n![adobe-xd](../../assets/images/adobe-xd.png)\n\n### Adding page transitions in Adobe XD\n\nFirst off, you'll need at least 2 artboards. Each artboard represents a page (or a new view in your app).\n\nOnce you have multiple artboards setup, click on the prototype tab. Then, you're going to want to select the element in your design that should be linked to the other artboard, such as a standard link for example. Once selected, click and drag the blue tab to the corresponding artboard, and then choose your animation type and speed.\n\n![adobe-xd-prototype](../../assets/images/adobe-xd-prototype.png)\n\nOnce linked, you can click the play button in the top right corner to view the animation, share the preview online, or even create a video walk-through of the pages.\n\n## Quickly Prototype Modules in CodePen\n\nFor more complex animations and/or animating specific elements on the page, CodePen is an extremely quick way to prototype. It has built-in CSS and HTML preprocessing and everything created on the site is easily shared.\n\n### Create a Pen\n\nHead on over to [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) and get comfy. You may want to start off by searching for a specific animation that you're looking for. However, if you know HTML and CSS you can create a new pen from scratch. Once you've got your pen created, save it and keep the URL handy for when you're reviewing that design with the client or developer.\n\nHere's a recent example of a simple hover animation we created for a custom home page module:\n\nSee the Pen [Animated \"tabs\" on Hover](https://codepen.io/stefen/pen/dZXqoG/) by Stefen ([@stefen](https://codepen.io/stefen)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).\n\n\u003Cp class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"365\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"stefen\" data-slug-hash=\"dZXqoG\" data-preview=\"true\" style=\"height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Animated &amp;amp;quot;tabs&amp;amp;quot; on Hover\">\u003Cspan>See the Pen \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/stefen/pen/dZXqoG/\">Animated &amp;quot;tabs&amp;quot; on Hover\u003C/a> by Stefen (\u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/stefen\">@stefen\u003C/a>) on \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nNot only does it make it easier to convey the vision for the design, but the same code can also be used in development for maximum efficiency.\n\n## For non-developers: Keynote is awesome!\n\nI know coding isn't for everyone... shocker! Well don't worry, because you can create some pretty amazing animations in Apple's Keynote software. [InVision has a really great blog post on how to do this](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/animating-your-ui-designs-in-keynote/). The basic idea is that you create a beginning and end state for your animation, add those elements to a slide and use Keynote's built-in animation tools to go from the beginning and end state and export as a video.\n\n## Motion Design Is More Important Than Ever\n\nAnimations on the web are easily overlooked elements of the standard website design process and hard to explain without building some type of prototype. Using any one of the above 3 techniques will improve your end product. Even if you don't build a prototype yourself, there are plenty of amazing examples on CodePen that you might want to incorporate into your design.\n\n---\n\n[Originally published on Bluleadz](https://www.bluleadz.com/blog/how-to-add-animations-to-your-static-designs-using-adobe-xd-and-codepen)","src/content/blog/how-to-add-animations-to-your-static-designs-using-adobe-xd-and-codepen.md",[149,150],"../../assets/images/adobe-xd.png","../../assets/images/adobe-xd-prototype.png","2a5fef992face4fc",{"html":153,"metadata":154},"\u003Cp>Designers creating new website mockups will generally use Photoshop then save those mockups as a JPG or PNG for the client to review.

This is one of the primary reasons why it's so hard to take an existing design and \"make it responsive\". It really needs to be thought through in the design phase and not be a tacked-on (buggy) feature after the fact.\n\n![issc website redesign](../../assets/images/issc-website-redesign-desktop-phone.jpg)\n\n_An example of responsive design (desktop and phone)._\n\n## The Critical Pages\n\nThe critical pages on an eCommerce website include not only the home page, but the product page and the entire checkout process.  These pages need a special attention to detail in order to create the absolute best user-experience for your new *and* returning customers.\n\nOne common bad practice on eCommerce websites is requiring a customer to create an account before checking out.

Include the Client as Soon as Possible.**\n\nThe absolute best way to reduce the number of revisions on any design project is to include the client at the very beginning of the process.  This may sound counter-intuitive, but the sooner you can get a feel for the client’s wants and needs, the sooner you will get a finished product out the door.  At Bluleadz, we include the client even in the very first design phase: wireframing.  This comes with some hurdles, but as long as you communicate to the client what a wireframe is and the purpose of the wireframe, the client will be able to get a visual and start providing feedback from the get-go.\n\nGetting more feedback in the beginning phase will prevent more revisions in the next phase.  The bottom line – The sooner you get feedback, the less work you’ll have to do on the finished product.  It is MUCH easier to make big changes in the early phases compared to the ending phases.\n\n## **2\\. Get feedback from the Entire Company**\n\nIf you are working with a larger company, “the client” could mean a multitude of people.  You could be working with a single person as your point of contact, for instance a marketing manager, but that single person is not the only opinion you should consider.  In these types of situations, you’ll want to make sure the “marketing manager” shows the wireframes and designs to all of the various higher ups in the company to get feedback and approval from the very beginning.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter if the “marketing manager” likes the wireframe, design, and final product when the other key decision makers in the company see the final product and disapprove.  You’ll have to start back at the beginning, wasting valuable time and resources.  This is why it’s extremely important to be sure all the various people in the company (especially the higher ups) have reviewed each phase of the project and given their feedback and approval early on in the process.\n\n## **3\\. Communicate and Explain the Reasoning behind Design Choices**\n\nAt some point, inevitably, you’ll get to a place where the client wants to change something in the design that you, the professional, completely disagree with -- e.g. “make the logo bigger”, “make it pop”, or “use \\[insert font name here\\] font instead”. This is one of the main reasons why designers don’t like to include clients early on in the design process.  Disagreements and confrontations will happen, but this is an opportunity to justify the design choice and provide evidence why it is better than the alternatives.\n\nMany designers (and most people in general) try to avoid confrontation altogether and will cave to their client’s wants, even if they know that it’s a not good design choice.  You, being the professional, should be able to provide a convincing argument on why your design choice makes the most sense and provides the best user experience over the alternatives.  More often than not, the client will agree with you and you won’t have to make something that you are not proud of.  If you have trouble with doing this, just remind yourself: if they knew everything you knew, they wouldn’t have hired you.  That being said, you shouldn’t immediately discredit all feedback from the client because your design is “perfect”.  After all, they know their customer base better and may bring up valid points for you to consider in the design.\n\nThat’s it.  By including the client as early as possible (making sure “the client” includes all possible decision makers in the company) and communicating the reasoning behind your design you will lessen the amount of work and yield a better final product that is launched on time.\n\n---\n\nOriginally posted on [HubSpot's Design Blog](https://designers.hubspot.com/blog/reduce-client-revisions)","src/content/blog/how-to-reduce-a-clients-design-revisions.md",[242],"../../assets/images/phelps_revisions.jpg","309c138e3e5df338",{"html":245,"metadata":246},"\u003Cp>Imagine this — You’re in the final stretch of launching your client’s website (this could be any type of design project really, but we’ll use a website in our example).  You’ve finalized the design, coded everything, and squashed all the bugs only to hear back from the client, “It looks great, but it needs some tweaking…” This “tweaking” ends up consisting of basically redesigning the entire website over a period of time that ends up taking twice as long as expected.  The sad thing is, this happens all too often in our industry.  At \u003Ca href=\"http://www.bluleadz.com/\">Bluleadz\u003C/a>, we have learned of 3 basic ways to prevent these types of situations as well as lowering the overall number of client design revisions in general over the years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-include-the-client-as-soon-as-possible\">\u003Cstrong>1.

Recently, I created a replacement in a project using Flexbox just because it has broader overall support in older browsers but either option makes changing the gutter extremely simple thanks to the `gap` property that [now has broad support](https://caniuse.com/?search=gap) in browsers.\n\n## The Flexbox HubSpot Grid Styles\n\n```css\n.row-fluid {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 0.5rem;\n}\n.row-fluid [class*=\"span\"] {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n.row-fluid .span12 {\n  flex-basis: 100%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span11 {\n  flex-basis: 91.66%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span10 {\n  flex-basis: 83.33%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span9 {\n  flex-basis: 75%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span8 {\n  flex-basis: 66.66%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span7 {\n  flex-basis: 58.33%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span6 {\n  flex-basis: 50%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span5 {\n  flex-basis: 41.66%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span4 {\n  flex-basis: 33.33%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span3 {\n  flex-basis: 25%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span2 {\n  flex-basis: 16.66%;\n}\n.row-fluid .span1 {\n  flex-basis: 8.33%;\n}\n@media (max-width: 767px) {\n  .row-fluid {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is basically 1-to-1 with the original HubSpot `layout.css` file but instead of using `margin` and `width` for the gutter and column sizing we are using `gap` and `flex-basis` which means you can now change the gutter without having to re-calculate all the percentages in every single class—hallelujah!\n\n## The CSS Grid HubSpot Grid Styles\n\nIf you prefer the newer CSS Grid syntax (or just don't need support for IE) here's how you'd do it:\n\n```css\n.row-fluid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);\n  gap: 0.5rem;\n}\n.row-fluid .span12 {\n  grid-column: span 12;\n}\n.row-fluid .span11 {\n  grid-column: span 11;\n}\n.row-fluid .span10 {\n  grid-column: span 10;\n}\n.row-fluid .span9 {\n  grid-column: span 9;\n}\n.row-fluid .span8 {\n  grid-column: span 8;\n}\n.row-fluid .span7 {\n  grid-column: span 7;\n}\n.row-fluid .span6 {\n  grid-column: span 6;\n}\n.row-fluid .span5 {\n  grid-column: span 5;\n}\n.row-fluid .span4 {\n  grid-column: span 4;\n}\n.row-fluid .span3 {\n  grid-column: span 3;\n}\n.row-fluid .span2 {\n  grid-column: span 2;\n}\n.row-fluid .span1 {\n  grid-column: span 1;\n}\n@media (max-width: 767px) {\n  .row-fluid {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI'm sure HubSpot will eventually update the default boilerplate layout styles to Flexbox or CSS Grid 🤞—&thinsp;I've learned that if you bug Jon McLaren enough times, in the HubSpot Developers Slack channel, anything can happen. 😜","src/content/blog/custom-grid-gutters-on-hubspot.md",[271],"../../assets/images/edit-drag-and-drop-areas-in-page-editor.png","7cce56f96d061ac4",{"html":274,"metadata":275},"\u003Cp>The default \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/src/css/objects/_layout.css\">12-column grid system provided by HubSpot\u003C/a> for the drag-and-drop page editor is based off outdated CSS rules that are a huge pain to change without breaking things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Instead of trying to work inside the old way of doing things with floats and complicated calculations to create columns and the space between columns—let’s rewrite them from scratch with modern properties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are two ways you could write the new grid system: either using Flexbox or CSS Grid.

I think we can all agree that updating product data can be a huge pain in the butt and a major","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../assets/images/step-3-1.gif",[145],"It happens all the time. You get a CSV file full of products with new pricing and you're tasked with updating the products on the website with this new data. I think we can all agree that updating product data can be a huge pain in the butt and a major time suck—especially if you're doing it one-by-one. Well, I'm here to let you in on a little Excel secret called a VLOOKUP that's going to make your life a whole lot easier. It sounds complicated but don't worry, I'll walk you through **step-by-step how to perform a VLOOKUP in Excel**. **You'll thank me later**.\n\n## First Things First—Organize The Data\n\nBefore we get started, you're going to need a CSV product export from your website's database of all your current products that need updating. Most eCommerce platforms have this functionality built-in or have an add-on/extension that will allow for it. You also need the updated product data CSV (xls file will also work fine). Or, if you'd like to follow along using our example files you can download our two sample files below:\n\n[Download \"outdated.csv\"](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2049201/Documents/outdated.csv?t=1496938110509)   [Download \"updated.csv\"](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2049201/Documents/updated.csv?t=1496938110509)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: **Create a New Column**\n\nIn your product database export or the \"outdated.csv\" in our sample files, create a new column. We're going to be updating the cost in our example so we'll name this column \"Updated Cost\".\n\n![step 1](../../assets/images/step-1-column.png)\n\n## Step 2: **Perform The VLOOKUP**\n\nUnder the title of the new column, select the cell, click on \"Insert Function\" and choose VLOOKUP (the search box is your friend).\n\n![step 2](../../assets/images/step-1.5.png)\n\nYou should now see a window called \"Function Arguments\" that has a few empty fields. The first field titled \"**Lookup_value**\" is going to be the common attribute that is shared between the *old data* and the *new data*.  In our example, we'll use the SKU, cell A2. Got it? Good.\n\nSelect the next field titled \"**Table_array**\" and now go to the updated product data sheet \"**updated.csv**\" and select the entire column range starting from the common attribute, *the SKU column*, and ending with the column with the new data, *the Cost column*.\n\n**PROTIP:** both CSV files need to be opened in the same workbook. Otherwise, you will not be able to select the \"Table_array\" in the other file.\n\nPhew! If you made it this far you should start singing \"she'll be comin' round the mountain\" because we're almost there... yeah baby!\n\nThe next field \"**Col_index_num**\" is the column data that you want to return. In other words, the column with the updated data. To find this simply count the number of columns there are from the common attribute (SKU column A) and the column with the new data (Cost column D). In our example, this number is 4.\n\nThe last field \"**Range_lookup**\" is there to specify whether you want the closest match (TRUE) or an exact match (FALSE). We'll want to use the value FALSE.\n\nIf you followed the instructions in the sample files, your function arguments should now look like this:\n\n![step 2](../../assets/images/step-2.png)\n\n## Step 3: **Check The Data**\n\nHit OK in the \"Function Arguments\" window and it should return the updated cost.  This is where the real magic happens.  Double click (or drag) the black square in the corner of the cell and the rest of the costs will populate automatically. Yes, that just happened. Yes, I just saved you hours worth of work. You're welcome and **[I told you so](#thank-you-stefen)**.\n\n![step 3](../../assets/images/step-3-1.gif)\n\nAt this point, you can move the updated cost into the existing cost column, save and import this sheet back into the product database.","src/content/blog/how-to-use-excels-vlookup-to-quickly-update-product-data.md",[297,298,299,300],"../../assets/images/step-1-column.png","../../assets/images/step-1.5.png","../../assets/images/step-2.png","../../assets/images/step-3-1.gif","65881d2869424828",{"html":303,"metadata":304},"\u003Cp>It happens all the time.

The WordPress experience is entirely dependent on how your theme is built. HubSpot has an extremely easy-to-use page editor. By using [Timber](http://timber.github.io/timber/) in combination with [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), you can have an extremely similar experience (or better) with WordPress.\n\n## 2\\. Migrate the HubSpot Forms into a WordPress Forms Plugin\n\nBefore we can migrate landing pages, it's important to choose a good WordPress forms plugin. If you're used to HubSpot's drag and drop form builder, then I'd highly recommend [Ninja Forms](https://ninjaforms.com/), [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/), or [WPforms](https://wpforms.com/). They all have their own unique benefits so test them all out and see which one you like best. If you don't need need the drag and drop interface, [Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/) works great and gives developers all the control they desire including being able to write almost all the markup themselves. Once you decide which forms plugin is best for you, then you can migrate all the forms over.\n\n## 3\\. Migrate the HubSpot Site Pages & Landing Pages to WordPress Pages\n\nNow that you've got your forms migrated, you can migrate each site page and landing page. I usually like to have 1 landing page template and use the default template for all other standard site pages. However, depending on your website's design, you may need more.\n\n## 4\\. Migrate the HubSpot Blogs to WordPress Posts\n\nWordPress offers an RSS feed import tool, but unfortunately, HubSpot will only display up to 50 posts in their RSS feeds. So if you have less than 50 blog posts, you should be all set for a 1-click import! If you have more than 50, then you've only got a few options: copy and paste each post by hand, develop a custom migration tool using the HubSpot API, or by [exporting your blog to a CSV using a custom coded blog template](https://www.bluleadz.com/blog/how-to-export-a-hubspot-blog).\n\nIn addition to these 4 steps you'll probably want to import all your URL Mappings (redirects), backup all of your files in the HubSpot File Manager (FTP it to your new host), as well as export your contacts and any emails/workflows to a different email provider if you want to keep those.\n\n## Performance Metrics: Before (HubSpot) & After (WordPress)\n\nHere are some performance metrics of a HubSpot COS website (before) and the WordPress site (after) to give you an idea of what's possible and how it compares. For some context, the WordPress site is using [Cloudflare's free CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and a standard hosting plan from [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1029607) (~$100/yr).\n\n![before](../../assets/images/webpagetest-burkmoreland-before.png)\nBefore\n\n![after](../../assets/images/webpagetest-burkmoreland-after.png)\nAfter\n\n---\n\nNeed help with a HubSpot to WordPress migration?

Modal windows are great for adding extra content on a page that would normally take up a large amount of space.\n\nThey also reduce it down to a simple link which can be virtually any size you want. The best ways to use these modals are video embeds, forms for bug reporting or getting feedback on a new layout, disclaimer/disclosures, and a whole lot more.\n\nNow that you know what a modal window is and the best time to use them, I'm going to walk you through how to make one on HubSpot's COS platform using their new custom modules feature in three simple steps.\n\nThe first thing you're going to need to do is download a modal window plugin. There are a bunch of plugins out there that do similar things, but Magnific Popup is my personal favorite due to its simplicity and usability. Smashing Magazine has a [great article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/02/truly-responsive-lightbox/) about the process of making it and all of it's various features.\n\n## Step 1: Download Magnific Popup\n\nThere are two core parts to Magnific Popup, the javascript (JS) file and the stylesheet (CSS) file. To keep things simple, I've already used [their build tool](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/#mfp-build-tool) to create the javascript file with the settings we'll need and linked both files for you to download below:\n\n[Magnific Popup JS](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/57042/js/blog-tutorials/magnific-popup.js?t=1496669956379) [Magnific Popup CSS](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/57042/js/blog-tutorials/magnific-popup.css?t=1496669956379)\n\n## Step 2: Create The Custom Module\n\nGo into your design manager and click on \"Create New Custom Module\". Call this module \"Modal Popup\".  If there are placeholder fields already in place, you will need to delete them on the left and delete all the code on the right.  Once that's done it should look like this:\n\n![modal popup module step 1](../../assets/images/modal-popup-module-1.png)\n\nNow, you'll need to create a _rich text field_ called \"**Modal Popup**\" and a _text field_ called \"**Modal Button**\".  Once that is done, copy the following snippet of code and paste it into the text area.\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- The button -->\n\u003Ca href=\"#{{ widget.modal_button|replace('&','and')|replace(' ','-')|replace('(','-')|replace(')','-')|replace('?','')|replace('\"','')|replace(\"'\",\"\")|replace(\".\",\"\")|replace(\":\",\"\")|replace(\",\",\"\") }}\" class=\"open-popup-link\">{{ widget.modal_button }}\u003C/a>\n\n\u003C!-- the modal popup is hidden until the button is clicked -->\n\u003Cdiv id=\"{{ widget.modal_button|replace('&','and')|replace(' ','-')|replace('(','-')|replace(')','-')|replace('?','')|replace('\"','')|replace(\"'\",\"\")|replace(\".\",\"\")|replace(\":\",\"\")|replace(\",\",\"\") }}\" class=\"white-popup mfp-hide\">\n    {{ widget.modal_popup }}\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003C!-- Copy and paste your css file between the quotations in the href below -->\n\u003Clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"CSS_File_URL_Goes_Here\">\n\u003Cstyle>\n    .white-popup {\n      position: relative;\n      background: #FFF;\n      padding: 20px;\n      width: auto;\n      max-width: 500px;\n      margin: 20px auto;\n    }\n\u003C/style>\n\n\u003C!-- Copy and paste your js file between the quotations in the src below -->\n\u003Cscript src=\"JS_File_URL_Goes_Here\">\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript>\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('.open-popup-link').magnificPopup({\n          type:'inline',\n          midClick: true\n        });\n    });\n\u003C/script>\n```\n\nNow your custom module should look like this:\n\n![modal popup module step 2](../../assets/images/modal-popup-module-2.png)\n\nLast thing you'll need to do is upload the two files you downloaded in step one into your portal's file manager, copy each URL, and replace the placeholder text \"CSS_File_URL_Goes_Here\" with your Magnific-Popup.css URL and \"JS_File_URL_Goes_Here\" with your Magnific-Popup.js URL. Alternatively, if you're going to use more than one on a single page, you should place the CSS in your site's header and the JS scripts in your site's footer.\n\n## Step 3: Try Out Your Awesome New Modal Window Module!\n\nEdit any page that has a flex column, and add your shiny new custom module to the page, and give the modal button a name and Voila! *\\-- If it's not working, be sure that your site has the latest version of jQuery by going to your content settings and changing the jQuery dropdown to version 1.11.x --* If you found this tutorial helpful let us know in the comments below and we'll write some more tutorials.

In part 2 (this post!), I'll be discussing the technical aspects of making the team member photos/videos come alive on the web, some issues we faced and how we solved them. If you haven't seen it yet, be sure to **[check out our awesome about page](https://www.growwithsms.com/about) before you do anything else!**\n\n## How We Created Our Team Member \"Moving Photos\"\n\nThe key to creating photos that come to life — the Harry Potter effect if you will — was to use native HTML5 video elements, hiding the video controls and using the first frame of the video as the video thumbnail (aka the \"poster\"). For example, the basic HTML for Matt's video looks like this:\n\n```html\n\u003Cvideo id=\"video\" poster=\"/videos/Matt-Johnson.png\">\n  \u003Csource src=\"/videos/Matt.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n\u003C/video>\n```\n\nNOTE: the controls attribute is completely omitted from the video element purposefully so the controls are hidden from the end-user.\n\nAt this point we have what is essentially just a still photo. Now we need an *event* to trigger the video to play. We'll use javascript to manipulate the [HTMLMediaElement API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) to play the video on hover. We chose to use the *on hover event* so users could unknowingly trigger it as they browse the page*.* Th*e* javascript looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar teamMember = $(\"#video\").hover(hoverVideo);\nfunction hoverVideo(e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  $(this).get(0).play();\n}\n```\n\nThe default behavior after a web video ends is to pause on the last frame. This resulted in a funky looking Team Photos page after the videos were all played. So we needed to adjust our script to show the poster/thumbnail image once the video ended. Thankfully, the HTMLMediaElement API has a \"currentTime\" property and an \"ended\" property so we were able to change the play position back to the beginning after the video has finished loading (this worked for us because our thumbnail image was actually just the first frame). Now the script looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar teamMember = $(\"#video\").hover(hoverVideo);\nfunction hoverVideo(e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  $(this).get(0).play();\n  $(this).on(\"ended\", function () {\n    this.currentTime = 0;\n    this.pause();\n  });\n}\n```\n\nNOTE: Internet Explorer played the video on repeat so we added the pause event to fix this bug.\n\n## Optimizing for Performance\n\nAt this point we had achieved the effect we were shooting for and were extremely happy with the way it looked and functioned. Now, we needed to figure out how to have 15 of these \"moving photos\" on the page without affecting page performance or causing an extremely large amount of data to be downloaded — a big concern for mobile visitors.\n\nTo save mobile users from downloading large amounts of data we disabled the video's preload functionality. In addition, we converted the videos from h.264 encoded MP4 files to the latest VP9 encoded WebM video file standard. This one change made our average file size go from 4MB per video to just under 1MB, a 75% data savings!\n\nThe WebM file format also comes with the added benefit of having a low computational footprint. In other words, playing 15 videos simultaneously no longer slowed the page down to a crawl on low powered desktops/laptops.","src/content/blog/make-awesome-us-page-part-2-code.md",[459],"../../assets/images/behind-the-team-member-photos.jpg","f4af471c96344828",{"html":462,"metadata":463},"\u003Cp>Lief discussed the planning and production stages of our about page overhaul in part 1.

However, this creates a problem with traditional dropdown navigation menus. When tabbing through, you can't access the dropdown items since they typically require a mouse hover.\n\nTo address this issue, you have a couple of options. One approach is to go the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/dropdowns/#single-button-dropdowns) route and require a click to display the dropdown (equivalent to pressing the return key on a keyboard). Alternatively, you can utilize a combination of CSS Hover state for mouse users and employ some [JavaScript hackery](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/accessible-drop-down-menus) to make the dropdown display itself when the parent item receives focus state, mimicking a mouseover interaction. Both approaches necessitate additional client-side JavaScript to ensure full accessibility.\n\nHowever, thanks to a new CSS pseudo-class, we can eliminate the need for this extra JavaScript and simplify the entire process using `:focus-within`.\n\n## The Markup\n\nIf you've been coding HTML navigation menus for a while now, you'll know the basic technique already. Your markup should look something like this:\n\n```html\n\u003Cnav>\n\t\u003Cul>\n\t\t\u003Cli>\n\t\t\t\u003Ca href=\"/page\">Page link\u003C/a>\n\t\t\t\u003Cul>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"/page/subpage\">I'm a dropdown item\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\t\t\t\u003C/ul>\n\t\t\u003C/li>\n\t\t\u003Cli>\n\t\t\t\u003Ca href=\"/page\">Another link\u003C/a>\n\t\t\u003C/li>\n\t\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/nav>\n```\n\n## The Styles\n\nAnd then use some basic styles to make it look like a menu and show the dropdown on hover like this:\n\n```css\nnav ul {\n\tdisplay: flex;\n\tgap: 1rem;\n\tlist-style: none;\n\tmargin: 0;\n\tpadding: 0;\n}\nnav ul li {\n\tposition: relative;\n}\nnav ul li ul {\n\tposition: absolute;\n\ttop: 100%;\n\tleft: 0;\n\tvisibility: hidden;\n}\nnav ul li:hover ul {\n\tvisibility: visible;\n}\n```\n\n## The New Good Good\n\nThis is where you can skip the entire JavaScript portion of this process and add just a single extra line to your hover styles:\n\n```css\nnav ul li:hover ul,\nnav ul li:focus-within ul {\n\tvisibility: visible;\n}\n```\n\nTypically this is when you learn that there isn't enough browser support for this new sparkly web thing you just learned about and can't use it — But wait! It's actually quite good and [all modern browsers have supported](https://caniuse.com/css-focus-within) it for at least a couple years now. 🕺\n\nIt's nice when new standards come out that simplify things that used to be a lot more complex and all the browsers hop on board. 🥰","src/content/blog/keyboard-accessible-dropdown-menu.md",[485],"../../assets/images/keyboard-accessible-dropdown-menu.png","003bed0d4d4eee36",{"html":488,"metadata":489},"\u003Cp>When browsing the web via a keyboard, tabbing through page links is the primary way to navigate around a page quickly.

If you build it, they will come... right? Unfortunately, it's not always that easy. By implementing our tips and best practices, however, you'll have a much better shot at getting your products in front of your audience.\n\n## On-Page SEO 101\n\nThere are 4 basics of on-page SEO that you should know if you have an eCommerce website:\n\n- **[Page Content](#page-content)**\n- **[Page Title](#page-title)**\n- **[URL](#url)**\n- **[Meta Description](#meta-description)**\n\n![Monkey at a keyboard](../../assets/images/banging-keyboard-monkey.gif \"Monkey at a keyboard\")\n\nLet's dive into these 4 principles so you can spend less time feeling like a monkey at a keyboard and start developing an SEO strategy for your website.\n\n### Page Content\n\nGood content is unique, specific and can be linked to easily. It is **the most important part of your SEO strategy**. The other 3 basics all revolve around your page content. Think of your page content as the foundation to a house. It's great to spend time painting and putting up curtains, but if your foundation is not stable, then you're doing a lot of work for no real reason.\n\n_In HTML, page content looks like:_\n\n```html\n\u003Ch1>\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg /> \u003Cvideo>\u003C/video>\n```\n\nLet's say, for example, we have a category page for \"Hard Hats\". Ask yourself, if someone is looking for hard hats, what information would they want to know and what is their intent? If I were searching for hard hats, I would want to read about the different types available, reviews of the best hard hats, price range and pros and cons to each type.\n\nOn an eCommerce site this type of content can be a roadblock because so many of the pages are generated dynamically — you may not have direct access in order to add content to a category page. This is one of the reasons why **having a blog is so important** for an eCommerce website. A blog is where you can generate great content without having to get a developer involved. In our example above, you could write a blog post about \"The Top 10 Hard Hats Available Today\" or \"What You Need to Know When Buying a Hard Hat\" and appeal to a visitor's specific intent.\n\nHaving great, valuable content includes not only text-based content but photos and videos! Once you have great content then you should be optimizing the content itself with structural header tags (H1, H2, etc.), **bolding the important words**, alt tags on images and providing video transcripts on your video embeds.\n\nSpecific examples of great content for an eCommerce website include product reviews, set-up/installation videos and articles, troubleshooting posts, product FAQs, product photos and educational pieaces to name just a few.\n\n### Page Title\n\nA page title is what is displayed at the top of the browser window and it is the primary text displayed in search engines — the big blue link! — and social media sites. It should be no longer than 60 characters, otherwise it will be truncated and end with a \" . . . \" ...so choose your words wisely!\n\n_In HTML, the page title looks like:_\n\n```html\n\u003Ctitle>I'm the page title!\u003C/title>\n```\n\nIt may sound obvious but an optimized page title should reflect what the page is about. In our example above it should be something like \"How to Choose The Right Hard Hat\" or \"Hard Hats: The Cornerstone to Proper Head Protection\". It should appeal to a user's intent so that they know what to expect when they click on the link.\n\n### URL\n\nThe page URL should be easy to read as well as structural in regards to it's [categorical relation to the rest of the website](../../assets/images/website-structure-best-practices). Here is an example of an optimized URL:\n\n```html\nhttps://example.com/ppe/hard-hats\n```\n\nAnd here is an example of a bad URL:\n\n```html\nhttp://example.com/store.html?page-id=78922048\n```\n\nThe first example is clear to the user that it's a page about hard hats and that it's part of a broader category \"PPE\" and that it's also a secure/encrypted page. The second example is an insecure page and it is not obvious what the page is besides being some kind of store.\n\n### Meta Description\n\nThe meta description is what shows up under the page title in search engines and social media sites. It should be limited to no more than 155 characters to prevent being truncated.\n\n_In HTML the meta description looks like this:_\n\n```html\n\u003Cmeta name=\"description\" content=\"I'm the meta description!\" />\n```\n\nAn optimized meta description should describe what the page is about. Meta descriptions are [not an important factor for ranking in search engines](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html), however, they are an important factor in getting the user to click on your link. Knowing this, you should think of your description as more an ad for your page rather than as another place to put your keywords.\n\n## That's a Wrap\n\nNow you know the current 4 principles to on-page SEO.

A blog is where you can generate great content without having to get a developer involved.

Without a brand to build on, there's not much of a reason to not use any of the off-the-shelf prebuilt themes out there. However, when you have a solid brand and a style guide, this is when your website can really shine and bring a lasting, memorable experience to your visitors. Not only does it help give a solid footing to your website, but it also brings a unified look and feel to all of your marketing efforts whether that's print or digital, and everything in-between.\n\nThanks to the amazing work by my good friend, [Luke Kenney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-kenney-970473105/), we were able to create a refreshed brand and style guide that exceeded expectations.

Although, you could easily swap out the `\u003Cvideo>` element for a YouTube or Vimeo embed if you prefer. Here's what the markup looks like:\n\n```html\n\u003Cbutton class=\"open-modal\">Play Video\u003C/button>\n\n\u003Cdialog class=\"video-modal\">\n  \u003Cform method=\"dialog\">\n    \u003Cbutton class=\"video-modal-close\">Close\u003C/button>\n  \u003C/form>\n  \u003Cvideo controls width=\"720\">\n    \u003Csource src=\"example.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n    \u003Csource src=\"example.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  \u003C/video>\n\u003C/dialog>\n```\n\nNow, we need some javascript to trigger the modal on click of the button, play the video automatically so we don't require a second click from the user, and finally pause the video when the modal is closed.\n\n```javascript\nconst openModalButton = document.querySelector(\".open-modal\");\nconst modal = document.querySelector(\".video-modal\");\nconst video = document.querySelector(\".video-modal video\");\n\nopenModalButton.addEventListener(\"click\", function onOpen() {\n  // .showModal() is part of the HTMLDialogElement API\n  modal.showModal();\n  // .play() is part of the HTMLMediaElement API\n  video.play();\n});\n\nmodal.addEventListener(\"close\", function onClose() {\n  // \"Close\" button inside the form triggers \"close\" on dialog because of [method=\"dialog\"]\n  // .pause() is part of the HTMLMediaElement API\n  video.pause();\n});\n```\n\nThanks to the [HTMLDialogElement API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement) and [HTMLMediaElement API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement), we don't have to write hardly any code to create a fully accessible and performant video modal.\n\n## Live Demo\n\n\u003Cp class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"700\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"LYdxWay\" data-user=\"stefen\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n\t\u003Cspan>See the Pen \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/stefen/pen/LYdxWay\">\n\tSimple Video Modal with no dependencies\u003C/a> by Stefen (\u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/stefen\">@stefen\u003C/a>)\n\ton \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\u003C/span>\n\u003C/p>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nYou'll want to sprinkle some CSS in there to make it look nice, but it's pretty cool how far we can get without the use of any NPM packages if we choose to do so.","src/content/blog/simple-video-modal-with-no-dependencies.md",[632],"../../assets/images/video-modal.png","b6ed17d030f1ef47",{"html":635,"metadata":636},"\u003Cp>There are no shortages of great \u003Ca href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/\">video\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://micromodal.vercel.app\">modal\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://appleple.github.io/modal-video/\">plugins\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/\">out there\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://sorgalla.com/lity/\">these days\u003C/a>.

a Bible PWA in 2023","2023-05-22","How and why I built a Bible app from scratch using modern web technologies","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../assets/images/simple-bible-pwa.png","## Why another Bible app?\n\nI wasn't super impressed by the state of Bible apps: each one bombards users with marketing popups, requires account creation, or are just plain slow. I just wanted a simple Bible app that got out of the way, wasn't annoying to use, and put the focus on the reading experience. So... here we are... I made [yet another Bible app](https://astro-bible.netlify.app) that aims to provide a hassle-free and enjoyable way to engage with the Scriptures.\n\n## How it's made\n\nUsing my favorite all-in-one web framework — [Astro](https://astro.build/) — and with the help of [Thiago Bodruk's Bible XML and JSON project](https://github.com/thiagobodruk/bible), I was able to put together a really nice Bible app with support for dark mode, offline support, and even an AI powered pastor for you to get answers to your Bible questions (all the cool kids use AI these days so I've heard).\n\n## Let's dig into the features\n\nA few of my favorite things about the app:\n\n### Fluid typography\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"784\" autoplay loop muted playsinline src=\"/videos/fluid-typography.mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\nGood typography involves a handful of things that all need to play nicely together: size, line height, spacing, and the font itself. Using fluid sizes and line heights and the native operating system's font makes for a great reading experience.\n\n### Native Sharing UI\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"784\" autoplay loop muted playsinline src=\"/videos/native-sharing.mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\nThe [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) allows web developers to use the operating system's native UI for sharing individual verses. This means you can easily add a verse to your Notes app for instance, or as a text to your spouse. Since this is a web first app, if they don't have the app installed it will just open up in their browser.\n\n### Offline support\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"784\" autoplay loop muted playsinline src=\"/videos/offline-support.mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\nThis is basic but necessary. Too many apps and websites that should include offline support just don't. This one does. And it automatically downloads in the background without any interaction from the user required. Since Astro uses Vite under the hood it was fairly simple to implement the [Vite PWA plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app) which handles all the workbox/service worker logic for you.\n\n### AI Pastor\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"784\" autoplay loop muted playsinline src=\"/videos/ai-pastor.mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\nI was hesitant to add this because this is supposed to be a simple Bible app... but I think I was able to implement this without getting in the way of the user and I find it to be a lot more useful than I originally thought it would be. So far I've been really impressed with it's answers. Now if OpenAI can get their API to respond in under 10 seconds that would be even better but who am I to complain.\n\n## The future\n\nI've added the app to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.netlify.astro_bible.twa) but have yet to cough up the $100 for the Apple App Store... I also enquired about licensing the ESV translation which would be another ~$250.\n\nI finished everything I set out for it to be and I'll be using it as my daily Bible app for the foreseeable future.

A website's structure not only affects user experience","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../assets/images/sitemap.png",[511],"Having a good site structure that's easy to navigate and has a clear goal or purpose is imperative to keeping bounce rates low and visitors happy. A website's structure not only affects user experience, but it will also affect the way search engines see a site. In this article, I will explain how to create a site structure that users (and search engines) will love.\n\n## What Is A \"Good\" Site Structure?\n\nA good structure can be defined as *organized with a purpose*. How that structure actually looks can be defined differently depending on who you ask. Your website should be created for your target audience, not yourself. So, to know the best way to structure the site, you need to know **who** will be your \"_user_\" and how **they** prefer content to be organized. If you haven't defined who your target audience is, now would be a great time to do that. You can even take it a step further and define your primary [persona](\u003Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)>) to really narrow things down.\n\n![site structure](../../assets/images/sms-site-structure.png)\n\nBy far the most common way to structure pages is in a tree-like hierarchy with everything stemming from a single point-of-origin. This single point-of-origin on a website will be your **home page**. Your home page should be the \"Your Company in 30 seconds\" introduction that's quick, to the point and the most general. From there, you should be able to categorize your types of content to drill down and get more specific the further down the tree/hierarchy the user goes. **This is where things can get tricky.**\n\n## Every Page Has a Purpose\n\nWhen each page has a purpose, this purpose should also be conveyed to the end-user.  This can be done by having clear call-to-actions on each page that leads the visitor to the next step. Having a clear purpose for every page on your website will help you stay organized, reduce duplicate content and, in turn, help you rank better in SERPs (search engine results page).\n\n### Landing Page vs. Site Page\n\nCategorizing a landing page separate from a website page is a great way to intentionally give purpose to your pages. Technically they are both just pages, but a site page might be purely informational while the landing page is intentionally trying to convert a visitor into a lead. Having this clear distinction between a landing page and a site page will help you structure the site in a clear and concise manner.\n\n![primary navigation](../../assets/images/sms-primary-navigation.png)\n\n## Primary Navigation ≈ Site Structure\n\nOnce you nail down your site structure you should have a pretty good idea of what your navigation will look like. However, it shouldn't always be a 1-1 representation. If a user knows exactly what they are looking for, they should be able to get to it with as few steps as possible. But at the same time, you should not overwhelm a new visitor with too many options to choose from.\n\nA good example of this is to include first and second level pages in the navigation (remember, the home page is the root/point-of-origin) but exclude third level pages because it's rare that you'll have a good experience digging through layers and layers of menu items. One of the reasons why a good user experience is so important is because it has a direct relation to your ranking on SERPs.\n\n**PROTIP:** make sure your URL structure mimics your site structure.  If you have a parent page \"Web\" and a child page \"Email\" the parent page's url should be \"/web\" and the child page's URL should be \"/web/email\".\n\n## Available Tools\n\nWe humans are very visual beings. Being able to visualize what we're thinking in our heads is a great way to process information. A favorite tool of mine for visualizing a site is [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/). You could also use Word, Excel or even a basic notepad. But, if you're a fan of keeping things as-simple-as-possible, the best tool is probably just basic cardstock and a pen. On these cards, write each page name and lay them out on a table. This is a great time to involve your target audience or persona.\n\nIdeally, you would have a group of current customers and a group of potential customers that haven't heard of your company. Give them all the cards and ask them to structure the information. **You might be surprised by the results.**\n\nIf you have any additional insight or tips on how you decided on your website's structure, leave a comment below!","src/content/blog/website-structure-best-practices.md",[701,702,703],"../../assets/images/sms-site-structure.png","../../assets/images/sms-primary-navigation.png","../../assets/images/sitemap.png","ecb4f520ebcb01b7",{"html":706,"metadata":707},"\u003Cp>Having a good site structure that’s easy to navigate and has a clear goal or purpose is imperative to keeping bounce rates low and visitors happy.

I highly recommend using the search API going forward. This guide was written before the API existed but I'll leave it up as a reference.**\n\n---\n\nHave you ever wished your HubSpot blog had a search feature that didn't take you off your website — *looking at you, google search module* ? — and that it would search only for blog posts? Here is how I recently accomplished this task for [Quad City Safety](https://www.quadcitysafety.com/) and if you follow along, it's really not all that hard to implement yourself.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's break down what a HubSpot Blog Search consists of into its simplest form. It comes down to these three basic elements:\n\n1. [The Search Form](#search-form)\n2. [The Search Results Page](#search-results-page)\n3. [The Blog For Loop](#blog-for-loop)\n\n## 1\\. The Search Form\n\nThe first step to creating your blog search is to add an HTML module to your blog template and create a form with a single text input and a submit button like so:\n\n```html\n\u003Cform action=\"/blog/search\">\n  \u003Cinput name=\"query\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search the blog...\" />\n  \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\">Search\u003C/button>\n\u003C/form>\n```\n\nThe two important attributes to make note of for later are the form's action and the input's name. The action attribute's value is where you'll be taken when you submit the form. In this case, the value is the URL of the search results page (that we'll create in step 2). The name attribute's value is the parameter that will be added to the URL - which is what we'll target in our Blog loop in step 3 in order to populate the search results.\n\n## 2\\. The Search Results Page\n\nBefore you can get search results, you need a place to display those search results. Create a new site page (or landing page if you don't have the Website Add-On) using whichever basic template you prefer (we'll be modifying this template in step 3). The important thing is that you create the page with the URL you used in the value of the form's *action* attribute. Using our example above we'll create this page with \"/blog/search\" as the URL.\n\nOnce you've published this page, go ahead and test your search form now. I'll wait.\n\nDon't worry, I'll still be here.\n\n.\n\nI'm serious.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDone?\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOkay... Sure you are...\n\n.\n\nDid the form take you to the search results page? Did you see the query parameter added to the URL like so \"**/blog/search?query=my+search+example**\" but you don't see any search results?\n\n![search-results-page](../../assets/images/search-results-page.png)\n\n**Perfect!** Now let's create those search results.\n\n## 3\\. The Blog For Loop\n\nTo populate the search results page with actual results, we'll need to use HubL (HubSpot's server side programming language) to loop through and display the blog posts that contain our search query.\n\nGo ahead and edit the search results page's template (or clone it if you want to be safe) and add a HubL module where you want the search results to display on the page. In your HubL module we are going to be doing two primary things. First, we're going to use the **_[blog_recent_posts](https://designers.hubspot.com/en/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-functions#blog-recent-posts)_** function to pull in your most recent posts. Then, we'll filter those posts by their titles using the **_request.query_dict_** [HTTP request variable](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-variables#http-request-variables) to get the search query parameter from the URL. Here's the code:\n\n```twig\n{% set recent_posts = blog_recent_posts('default', 200) %}\n{% set searchQuery = request.query_dict['query'] %}\n\n{% for recent_post in recent_posts %}\n  {% if searchQuery and searchQuery|lower in recent_post.name|lower %}\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"post-title\">{{ recent_post.name }}\u003C/div>\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nNow, if you go back to your search input, you should see your matching search results:\n\n![hubspot blog search](../../assets/images/hubspot-blog-search.gif)\n\n**Awesome!** You just built yourself your first search engine!\n\nNow that you know the basics behind building a search in HubSpot, the sky's the limit. There are a ton of things you can do in addition to the basic search above such as advanced filtering by topics, search the content of the post in addition to the title, highlight the search term in the search results, or you could even Ajax the results into a modal popup window like my [HubSpot COS Modal Site Search plugin](https://github.com/growwithsms/HubSpot-COS-Site-Search).","src/content/blog/hubspot-blog-search.md",[914,915,916],"../../assets/images/search-results-page.png","../../assets/images/hubspot-blog-search.gif","../../assets/images/search-hubspot-blog.gif","5ee095f673bb7cb9",{"html":919,"metadata":920},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>2019 Update — \u003Ca href=\"https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/content/search-for-content\">HubSpot now offers a site search API\u003C/a>.

Even if all of your [images are optimized](../../assets/images/how-to-increase-your-pagespeed-insights-score-on-your-hubspot-website) and sized correctly, they can still cause performance issues, especially on longer pages that have lots of images—a pillar page or even a blog page, for example. This is where the \"Lazy Loading\" technique comes in to save the day.\n\n## What is Lazy Loading?\n\nThe default browser behavior will automatically load all the images on a page when the page initially loads. If the page has 100 images, it's going to try and load all 100 images and not stop until they're all loaded (slow website alert!). Lazy Loading is a technique that forces the browser to only load the images that are currently in-view and will load the rest as you scroll to them.\n\n![lazy-loading-images-hubspot-blog-1](../../assets/images/lazy-loading-images-hubspot-blog-1.png)\n\n### Lazy Loading Sounds Awesome! So, What's the Catch?\n\nThe primary problem with lazy loading is the fact that there are no images until you scroll down the page. This causes page reflow as you scroll, which will hinder a good user experience—you're essentially taking one step forward and two steps back.\n\n![lazy-loaded-image-reflow](../../assets/images/lazy-loaded-image-reflow.gif)\n\n☝️*page reflow caused by images loading. Say no to the reflow, kids.*\n\n### The Page Reflow Solution\n\nThe trick to getting around this issue is using a small (in terms of file size) placeholder image that is the same height/width as the full size image. HubSpot has a nice little feature that allows for automatic image resizing. This means we can generate the placeholder images automatically and use CSS to force the image to its full size to minimize page reflow. 🔥🔥🔥\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"788\" height=\"718\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" src=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/hubfs/Videos-16/lazy-loading-images-with-blurred-placeholder.webm\">\u003C/video>\n\n☝️*an example of lazy loading images on a slow internet connection*\n\nPretty sweet, right?! Here's how to make it happen...\n\n## How to Lazy Load Images on a HubSpot Blog\n\n### Step 1: Add the Lazy Loading JavaScript Plugin to Your Template\n\nFire up your design manager, edit the \"Listing Template,\" and add this script to the template:\n\n```html\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vanilla-lazyload/8.6.0/lazyload.min.js\">\u003C/script>\n```\n\n![design-manager-blog-script](../../assets/images/design-manager-blog-script.png)\n\nThere are a few different plugins out there, but I tend to prefer [this one](http://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/lazyload/).\n\n### Step 2: Update Your Featured Image Markup\n\nFind your blog post's featured image—it will look something like this:\n\n```twig\n\u003Cimg src=\"{{ content.post_list_summary_featured_image }}\" alt=\"{{ content.featured_image_alt_text }}\" class=\"hs-featured-image\">\n```\n\nNow update it to this:\n\n```twig\n\u003Cimg src=\"{{ content.post_list_summary_featured_image }}\" alt=\"{{ content.featured_image_alt_text }}\" class=\"hs-featured-image\" width=\"12\" style=\"width: 100%;\" data-src=\"{{ content.post_list_summary_featured_image|replace('/hubfs/' + hub_id, '/hub/' + hub_id + '/hubfs') }}?width=600\" data-srcset=\"{{ content.post_list_summary_featured_image|replace('/hubfs/' + hub_id, '/hub/' + hub_id + '/hubfs') }}?width=600 600w\">\n```\n\n### Step 3: There is No Step 3... That's it!\n\n**Automatic Image Resizing not working?**\n\nIf the code above isn't resizing the image, it's most likely due to the fact that your default file manager hosting domain was changed from HubSpot's CDN to your own domain. If that's the case, update the replace filter to the following to fix it:\n\n`|replace('/hubfs/', '/hs-fs/hubfs/')`\n\n### How It Works—An Explainer\n\nLet's review each new attribute added and explain what each one is doing.\n\n- `width=\"12\"`  this is what tells HubSpot's [automatic image resizer](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/COS-General/What-is-automatic-image-resizing) how large (or small, in this case), in pixels, the image should be sized to. This is what generates the placeholder in the `src` and `srcset`.\n- `style=\"width: 100%;\"`  this is the CSS to override the default image width (12px), so that it fills it's container. This is how we fix the reflow issue.\n- `data-src=\"...\" data-srcset=\"...\"`  this is where the full size images live that will be lazy loaded in with the JavaScript plugin, overriding the placeholder.\n\n## The Results\n\nWe recently added lazy loaded images to our blog and saw an improvement of close to 50% in initial page load times. Here are the before-and-after stats from webpagetest.org:\n\n[![Before Lazy Loading - Performance Metrics](../../assets/images/before-lazy-loading-metrics.png)](http://www.pngagetest.org/result/180201_79_f9735b4b0cd5e9237e3c76b24a9ffc14/)\n\n_☝️ Before Lazy Loading_\n\n[![After Lazy Loading - Performance Metrics](../../assets/images/after-lazy-loading-metrics.png)](http://www.pngagetest.org/result/180201_1X_4724c585e24bf4e45e7e81559319ffdc/)\n\n_☝️ After Lazy Loading_\n\n### Holy Macaroni, Batman—That's Fast!\n\nAs you can see, lazy loading images will give your site quite the performance improvement. [Google's recent anouncement about using page speed as a mobile search ranking factor](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html) means there has never been a better time to improve your site speed.

Like so:\n\n![Progressive Loading Image on Medium](../../assets/images/medium-image-loading.gif \"Progressive Loading Image on Medium\")\n\nProviding visual feedback to end users — **especially users with slower connections** — that something is happening is a great way to improve UX. Thanks to HubSpot's [automatic image resizing](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-general/what-is-automatic-image-resizing) and a nifty little script by David Desandro (the man behind [metafizzy](http://metafizzy.co/)) it's pretty easy to achieve the same effect on your HubSpot website:\n\n![Progressive Loading Background Image on HubSpot](../../assets/images/blur-up-image-loading.gif \"Progressive Loading Background Image on HubSpot\")\n\n---\n\n## How To Create Progressive Loading Images in HubSpot\n\n### Step 1: The HubL\n\nIf you haven't noticed, full-width image backgrounds are all the rage in web design these days. Because they are so large, they are the perfect candidate for this image loading technique. In HubSpot you'll need to either use a custom module or a HubL module so you can manipulate the image's _src_ attribute. We are using a custom module for our headers like so:\n\n```twig\n\u003Cdiv class=\"bg-section-header\"{% if widget.background_image.src %} style=\"background-image:url({{ widget.background_image.src }});\"{% endif %}>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"bg-section-header_placeholder\"{% if widget.background_image.src %} style=\"background-image: url({{ widget.background_image.src }}?width=20);\"{% endif %}>\u003C/div>\n    \u003Ch1>{{ widget.header }}\u003C/h1>\n    \u003Cp class=\"secondary-header\">{{ widget.secondary_header }}\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\nAs usual, we use an inline style for the image so it can be unique on each page. The real magic happens in the child div \"bg-section-header_placholder\". We use the same code to display the same image, but appending the src with \"?width=20\". Doing this tells HubSpot's servers to resize the image to 20px using their image resizing magic.\n\nOne thing to note, HubSpot uses two different URLs for loading images. One for images that are compressed/resized and one for images that are not compressed/resized:\n\n- Doesn't resize: **example.com/**hubfs**/image.png**\n- Does resize: _example.com/**hs-fs/hubfs**/image.png_\n\nBy default, the custom module will use the URL that doesn't resize the image. To get around this you can use the \"replace\" HubL filter to replace the default URL like so:\n\n```twig\n\u003Cdiv class=\"bg-section-header\"{% if widget.background_image.src %} style=\"background-image:url({{ widget.background_image.src }});\"{% endif %}>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"bg-section-header_placeholder\"{% if widget.background_image.src %} style=\"background-image: url({{ widget.background_image.src|replace('/hubfs/','/hs-fs/hubfs/') }}?width=20);\"{% endif %}>\u003C/div>\n    \u003Ch1>{{ widget.header }}\u003C/h1>\n    \u003Cp class=\"secondary-header\">{{ widget.secondary_header }}\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\n**NOTE**: if you prefer to use the default \"cdn2.hubspot.com\" URLs you'll need to use a different replace filter:\n\n```twig\n{{ widget.background_image.src|replace('/hubfs/' + hub_id, '/hub/' + hub_id + '/hubfs') }}\n```\n\n_Thanks Kenneth!_\n\n### Step 2: The CSS\n\nNow just add a little CSS and you'll have your background image and the small/blurry placeholder image:\n\n```css\n.bg-section-header {\n  background-color: #222;\n  background-position: center;\n  background-size: cover;\n  color: #fff;\n  position: relative;\n}\n.bg-section-header_placeholder {\n  background-color: #222;\n  background-position: center;\n  background-size: cover;\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition: opacity 400ms ease;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: The JavaScript\n\nNow the final step is to fade out the placeholder image once the full size image loads. With the [imagesLoaded](http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/) script, we can detect when the background image loads and create a function to change the opacity of the placeholder to 0 with this callback:\n\n```javascript\n$(\".bg-section-header\").imagesLoaded({ background: true }, function () {\n  $(\".bg-section-header_placeholder\").css(\"opacity\", \"0\");\n});\n```\n\n**Pretty cool, right?**\n\nThe only downside to doing this is that you are adding an extra HTTP request to the page. However, I would argue this being a non-issue with [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) just around the corner and, in the meantime, I believe the improved UX is a tradeoff well worth the extra 50 milliseconds.","src/content/blog/progressive-image-loading-with-hubspot.md",[1002,1003],"../../assets/images/medium-image-loading.gif","../../assets/images/blur-up-image-loading.gif","39b9b10b09c50f9e",{"html":1006,"metadata":1007},"\u003Cp>I am a big fan of the way Instagram’s mobile app and \u003Ca href=\"https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/\">Medium\u003C/a>’s website load images.

We are using a custom module for our headers like so:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code material-theme-darker\" style=\"background-color:#212121;color:#EEFFFF; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\"

use an inline style for the image so it can be unique on each page. The real magic happens in the child div “bg-section-header_placholder”. We use the same code to display the same image, but appending the src with “?width=20”. Doing this tells HubSpot’s servers to resize the image to 20px using their image resizing magic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing to note, HubSpot uses two different URLs for loading images. One for images that are compressed/resized and one for images that are not compressed/resized:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Doesn’t resize: \u003Cstrong>example.com/\u003Cstrong>hubfs\u003C/strong>/image.png\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Does resize: \u003Cem>example.com/\u003Cstrong>hs-fs/hubfs\u003C/strong>/image.png\u003C/em>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>By default, the custom module will use the URL that doesn’t resize the image.
